merge needs:
  --append
  --filter-reject-urls
  --filter-reject-sources

those will all be defaults most likely.

may want:
  --filter urls,sources,all,none [all] default0
  --no-filter [could be same args as above + restore (restore rejected urls)] 
    (longer term feature, when the need arises)

the hasCommaSuffix/RejectSuffix problem, where to put this. filter? update? markdown?<<===

merge:
* filter rejects from noteParse - compare filter reject code, ideally 1 place that accesses _filtered files
* why am I sorting
