* validateSources(name) -- enforce everywhere
* -t newton fails (-t probably doesn't honor candidate clues)
* -t (no --verbose) output sources is funny

validatesources is apparently happy with old:3=not:1,not:1,old:1
which is wrong because:
1) FIXED: two nots from two different variations of sentence three. i though i checked
   for and prevented this with the "candidates" thing somewhere
2) TODO: this is like that weird case with "bird" being the "name" of a clue that had
   "bird" as a source, and that should be disallowed.
   
clues3.json:  { "name": "old",             "src": "new,not" },
