* validateSources(name) -- enforce everywhere
* -t newton fails (-t probably doesn't honor candidate clues)

validatesources is apparently happy with old:3=not:1,not:1,old:1
which is wrong because:
1) two nots from two different variations of sentence three. i though i checked
   for and prevented this with the "candidates" thing somewhere
2) this is like that weird case with "bird" being the "name" of a clue that had
   "bird" as a source, and that should be disallowed.
clues3.json:  { "name": "old",             "src": "new,not" },

merge needs:
  --append
  --filter-reject-urls
  --filter-reject-sources

those will all be defaults most likely.

may want:
  --filter urls,sources,all,none [all] default0
  --no-filter [could be same args as above + restore (restore rejected urls)] 
    (longer term feature, when the need arises)

the hasCommaSuffix/RejectSuffix problem, where to put this. filter? update? markdown?<<===

merge:
* filter rejects from noteParse - compare filter reject code, ideally 1 place that accesses _filtered files
* why am I sorting
